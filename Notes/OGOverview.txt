Final Summary
	•	Access Flow:
Users must go through the Landing Page → Role Selection → Role-specific Sign In/Sign Up → Onboarding. Direct dashboard access without signing in is prohibited.
	•	Dashboards:
Each role has its own dashboard with a side menu for navigation among sub-pages (Home, Sessions, Reviews, Analytics, Settings, etc.).
	•	Databases:
The system uses separate databases for Teens, Companies, Surveys, Payment Transactions, and Audit Logging.
	•	Interconnected Data:
Admins can use the “View Details” feature to see a comprehensive, interconnected view of sessions, reviews, payments, and other metrics.
	•	Payment & Bonus Flow:
Companies set session rates; teen performance determines commission; companies can flag bonuses manually (with eligible teens automatically flagged via a “reward” button); all payment data is tracked.
	•	Security & Audit Logging:
Role-based access and API authentication ensure secure sessions. Audit logs track major actions, and data is encrypted as required.
	•	User Experience:
The teen interface uses a Tinder-like swipe system with gamification, while the company and admin interfaces are professional and designed for desktop use, with clear navigation and reporting tools.
