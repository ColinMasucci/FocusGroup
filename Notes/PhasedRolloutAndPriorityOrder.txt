How Each Module Connects
	•	Public Pages (Landing, Role Selection) serve as the initial entry point; they don’t require database connections but lead to the authentication flow.
	•	Authentication & Onboarding pages collect and validate data that is then stored in their respective databases (Teen, Company).
	•	Dashboards for each role are built to pull data from these databases, and each dashboard includes a side menu for navigating to sub-pages.
	•	Admin Dashboard not only offers management and oversight but also includes a “View Details” section that cross-references data from all databases for a complete system view.
	•	Payment and Bonus Modules update and retrieve financial data from the Payment Transactions Database and integrate with the main dashboard analytics.
	•	Audit Logging records major system actions and ensures all interactions are traceable.
