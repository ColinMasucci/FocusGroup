Focus Group App – Full Detailed Prompt

1. Overview & App Purpose
Focus Group App is a platform designed to connect companies with teens for market research and feedback. The app enables companies to gather real user insights while allowing teens to participate in focus groups anonymously. The platform also manages feedback, reviews, and secure payments. Its primary goals are to:
	•	Let companies schedule and manage focus groups.
	•	Allow companies to interact with teens without revealing personal identities.
	•	Enable both companies and teens to rate and review each other.
	•	Process secure payments with performance-based earnings.

2. User Roles and How They Sign In
There are three roles:
	•	Admins manage the entire system.
	•	Companies create and manage focus groups.
	•	Teens participate in focus groups and provide feedback.
Each role has its own sign-up and log-in process:
	•	Admins use a code-based login.
	•	Companies use a business email sign-up and log-in.
	•	Teens sign up with their demographic details and complete identity verification (using a third-party service like Onfido/Jumio and email/phone parental consent). (Optional facial recognition can be added later.)
Only signed-in users can access any dashboards or account pages. Direct access without logging in is not allowed.

3. Databases
The app uses separate databases to organize data:
	•	Teen Database: Holds teen profiles, demographic details, interests, session history, reviews, and payment records.
	•	Company Database: Contains company profiles, business details, verification status, focus group session details, reviews, and transaction records.
	•	Surveys Database: Keeps data on focus group sessions, including time, duration, mode (in-person or online), lists of participants, performance ratings, bonus flags, and feedback.
	•	Payment Transactions Database: Records all payment details, total funds, expenses, and commission information.
	•	Audit Logging Database: Logs major actions (like session creation, review submissions, payment processing) with timestamps and user identifiers.

4. Page Structure

7. Phased Rollout and Modular Approach
You will build this app one module at a time in create.xyz. The modules are:
	1.	Public Access & Role Selection:
Build the Landing Page with two buttons (Sign Up and Log In) and the Role Selection page.
	2.	Authentication & Onboarding:
Develop separate Sign Up and Log In pages for Teens and Companies, along with the Admin Sign In page. Ensure onboarding collects data and stores it in the Teen or Company Database.
	3.	Dashboards:
Create the Teen, Company, and Admin Dashboards with their side menus and sub-pages.
Link each sub-page to the correct database(s) for real-time data display.
	4.	Data Integration & Interconnections:
Connect the Surveys Database, Payment Transactions Database, and Audit Logging Database so that all interactions (sessions, reviews, payments) are visible.
Build the Admin “View Details” pages to aggregate this data.
	5.	Payment and Bonus System:
Integrate payment processing (Venmo, PayPal, bank transfers) and implement the commission calculation and bonus flag system.
	6.	Advanced Analytics & Audit Logging:
Implement charts, graphs, export options, and complete audit logging for system actions.
Each module is self-contained with explicit data flows. When complete, they all link together to form the full app.

Final Summary
	•	Navigation Flow:
Users land on the public Landing Page, then select their role. They either create a new account (Sign Up) or log in to an existing account (Log In).
All account access is through the authentication pages, and dashboards are not accessible by direct URL entry.
	•	Dashboards:
Each role (Teen, Company, Admin) has a dashboard with a side menu that directs users to specific sub-pages.
Data is stored in separate databases for Teens, Companies, Surveys, Payment Transactions, and Audit Logging.
	•	Data Interconnections:
The Admin Dashboard’s “View Details” pages show complete data on sessions, reviews, and payments by pulling data from all databases.
	•	Payment Flow:
Companies set session rates, teen performance determines commission, and bonus eligibility is flagged with a “reward” button. Payment records are tracked in the Payment Transactions Database.
	•	Security:
All access is secured through the Sign Up/Log In process. Major actions are logged in the Audit Logging Database.
